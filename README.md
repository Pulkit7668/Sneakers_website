Hey guys 

The Sneakers Website I developed showcases a wide range of styles and brands.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented interactive features like filtering options and image sliders.

The responsive design ensures that the website looks great on any device, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

Through CSS animations and transitions, I added subtle yet engaging effects to enhance the overall user experience.

JavaScript functionalities such as product search and dynamic loading of content improve the website's usability and efficiency.
